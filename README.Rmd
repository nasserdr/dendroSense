DendroSense package offers an intuitive graphical user interface to analyze Dendrometers data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of dendroSense from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#install.packages("dendroSense")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("nasserdr/dendroSense")
```
## Example

To run the GUI, open the file 'gui/DendroSenseGUI.R' and click on 'Run' or execute the following command
in the Console: 
```{r example}
library(dendroSense)
runGui()
```


**TO DO:**

- [ ] Code for treating gaps in large files automatically.
- [ ] Code for aggregating daily, phase and cycle statistics in a dataframe for a list of files.


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
